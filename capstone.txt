This repository is created for my final year college project as well as the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project.

I am working on this project to apply everything I have learned in data science, including data collection, data cleaning, SQL analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. Throughout this capstone, I will analyze real SpaceX
Falcon 9 launch data to predict whether the first stage of the rocket will land successfully and be reused.

All my notebooks, datasets, code, queries, visualizations, and project files will be stored here as a complete record of my work and learning.

This repository represents my practical journey in data science and the successful completion of my final project.
